% Purpose: Calculate the local (constituent level) stress and strain fields at the 
%          top and bottom of each ply in a composite laminate by first determining 
%          the full 3D strain at each point and then calling MicroFields.m
% Input:
% - Geometry: Struct containing laminate definition variables
% - Loads: Struct containing problem loading information
% - plyprops: Cell/struct containing effective composite material properties 
% - LamResults: Struct containing laminate analysis results
% Output:
% - LamResults: Struct containing laminate analysis results updated to include local 
%               micromechanics result ("Micro(kk)") per ply location
