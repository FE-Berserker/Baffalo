% Purpose: Calculate the local (constituent level) stress and strain fields in the
%          composite given the concentration tensors and global fields and 
%          temperature change
% Input:
% - FullGlobalStrain: Vector of global total strain components
% - DT: Applied temperature change
% - props: Struct containing effective composite properties
% - Results: Struct containing micromechanics analysis results
% Output:
% - Results: Updated struct containing micromechanics analysis results
